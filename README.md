# Microsoft-NCSI
A Microsoft NCSI web-server

This will fix that DNS/Enable Active Probing/Globe WiFi icon/WiFi Action Required issue!  ;)

## How to
Setup an IIS server by going to `Control Panel` -> `Programs and Features` -> `Turn Windows features on or off` -> Enable `Internet Information Services` with the defaults or your preferred options.

Please `wwwroot` contents inside of `%systemdrive%\inetpub\wwwroot`.
